            "In January 2014, alternative health and conspiracy web site NaturalNews.com posted a video showing Wheaties cereal flakes sticking to a magnet.",
            "The site claimed that this was irrefutable proof that the cereal is \"full of metal fragments.\"",
            "The video, created by \"The Health Ranger\" Mike Adams, was created to give the impression that the flakes were hidden in the cereal by a ne'er-do-well corporation:\nWheaties breakfast cereal, manufactured by General Mills, has been found to contain so many microscopic fragments of metal that individual flakes can be lifted and carried using common magnets, a Natural News Forensic Food Lab investigation has found and documented.",
            "However, the experiment performed by Adams is not new, nor is it limited to Wheaties.",
            "A spokesman for General Mills (which manufactures Wheaties) told us that the reaction is caused by iron fortification in the cereal and is not a cause for alarm:\nWe see this science experiment done pretty frequently with any iron fortified cereal – it makes for a cool video!",
            "Iron is really important for your body to function well, and your body only absorbs as much as it needs.",
            "Indeed, in 2011, Scientific American posted instructions on how to perform the experiment with any iron-fortified breakfast cereal:\nWhat does your breakfast cereal have in common with Earth's crust?",
            "They both have some of the same materials in them.",
            "It might seem strange to compare a bowl of cornflakes to a pile of dirt.",
            "But science can help us find one of the most common elements on Earth in your cereal: iron.",
            "Even though iron only makes up less than 5 percent of the mass on Earth, it is found in a lot of places: rocks, cereal—and even in your blood!",
            "It's also the most frequently used metal on the planet; it makes up most of steel, which is a mixture of iron and other ingredients.",
            "A quick review of searches for \"breakfast cereal magnet experiment\" shows that it is a popular children's experiment.",
            "Here, a similar experiment is successfully demonstrated with Total breakfast cereal:\nWe found no evidence suggesting that the iron contained in breakfast cereals that sticks to magnets in these types of experiments is any cause for alarm or harmful to health.",

            "That's pretty small, but much larger than a nano particle (i.e.",
            "nanometers or nm), which would be 100,000 times smaller!",
            "The best way to see the individual particles is to dump out the cereal and rinse the cup with the magnet still attached, then carefully remove the magnet (which will release the particles) and add a little water to the cup.",
            "The particles disperse throughout the water, but by holding your magnet near the cup (or taping the magnet to your tabletop and moving the cup near the magnet) you can watch the particles move around in the magnetic field.",

The following at home lab exercise will demonstrate that  iron is actually in iron fortified cereal such as Total.As you work through this section on minerals complete this lab exercise by the due date. How Much Iron is in Total Cereal?      The following at home lab exercise will demonstrate that iron is actually in iron fortified cereal such as Total.       Materials:1 cup iron fortified cereal (Total)2 cups of hot water (from the sink) 1 clear glass large enough to hold the cereal and the water.Magnet-  The magnet can be from an inexpensive refrigerator magnet.  You will be able to see the results better if you paint the magnet white or another light color.  You can use any kind of paint you might have handy.  If you don't have any paint the experiment will still work, it will just be a little harder to see the iron.Wooden spoon or Popsicle stick      Safety:  Only use hot tap water and do not eat the cereal after the experiment.       Exploration:Step 1     Examine the cereal and make a note of its appearance.  Read the ingredient label.     How is iron listed on the ingredient label? (Is it listed in a compound as iron (II), iron(III),           etc.) Step 2     Place a cup of the cereal into approximately 2 cups of hot tap water and stir with a wooden spoon or Popsicle stick to make a slurry.                What happens to the cereal?               After stirring for about a minute add the magnet to the mixture. Why did we use hot water instead of cold water?   Step 3     Let the cereal sit for approximately 45 minutes.  Be sure to stir the mixture well          every 15 minutes. Why is the stirring necessary?                       The longer the magnet remains in the mixture the better the results. Step 4     After 45 minutes remove the magnet and observe your results.  You should see metallic iron removed from your mixture by the magnet.  If you do not notice any iron on the magnet put the magnet back in the mixture for another 45 minutes.  Be sure to stir the mixture before removing the magnet.Describe the appearance of the iron on the magnet. Many cereals are fortified with vitamins and minerals that are needed for good health.   Metallic iron is added to fortified cereal. In this experiment the magnet collects the iron. Would you expect minerals to be removed with the magnet?  Why or why not?  Suggest some ways to improve the removal of iron from the cereal and reduce the amount of time needed for the iron to collect on the magnet.       Bonus: Why do manufacturers place metallic iron in cereals instead of using some other form of  iron?                    You will probably need to explore this question on the internet.",
